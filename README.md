# SP-500-Price-Predictor-Project
## **Intro**

We have all been hearing stories from our grandparents their time was harsh and we are much more luckly compare to them but is that true.

It seems the life at that time wasn't taht easy but people can afford house and car and maybe a summer hosue. However, it is not easy right now to achieve all of those things.

I am not going into a comparison but it is obvoius that we need a better control over on our money and how to invest it. Covid alomost impacted all of the house holds in the owrld. Prices went thought the roof and everything became much more diffuclt.

On the other hand, some others saw a opportunity and invest their money when there's blood in the streets. What are we missing, what should we and what should we look and where to put our money. All of these question are running in my mind for some time and I will try to answers my questions with help of one the newest and most popuular topic "Machine Learning".

## **Summary**

First thing first, I am not a financial advisor and this is not a financial advise. It is only out curiosity and want to do a dat aproject realted with this field.
